I'll never forget coming up from the Powell Street Station and being on Market Street.  Walking up Powell Street to the hotel.  Going to dinner and sitting in the Starlight Room looking out over the buildings and the hills and the pink skies.  That first week was amazing.  Monday night on Haight Street, Tuesday night on Columbus Avenue, Wednesday night in Chinatown, Thursday night in The Castro.  They days were spent going around to many different parts of The City - now places I see every day.  San Francisco has this energy that is hard to equal - because it is both intense and positive.  And, it's just a beautiful environment.",
